# ScrumSaga API Wrapper
This is the python API Wrapper for the [ScrumSaga API](www.scrumsaga.com).  This is typically used manually with Jupyter Notebooks, such as shown in the [guides](https://github.com/IMTorgDemo/Reports), but can be useful for development.  To use it, perform the following:

`$ git clone blahblah...`

```python
import sys
path = r'C:\Users\Jason\Documents\IPython Notebooks\Reports\ScrumSaga'
sys.path.append(path)
import ScrumSaga as saga
```
